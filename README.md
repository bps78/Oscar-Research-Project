# **Oscar Research Project**

Collaborating with UW-Madison's Office of Sustainability to perform an in-depth analysis and publish an article about data collected 
by Oscar Sort waste collection machines using Python, numPy, and Pandas. Utilizing association rule mining, linear regression and 
visualizations to identify weaknesses in recycling habits and provide insights for improvement.

This project will culminate in a published article sharing my findings.
